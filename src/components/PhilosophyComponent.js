      <h1>The Warrior Wisdom Martial Arts Philosophy</h1>
     <p>Throughout human history there has been warrior culture, a culture that emphasizes mastery of self in order to deal with the challenges of a changing environment
        In every part of the globe from Africa, to Europe, to Asia, and even The Americas there has been a culture of warriorship passed down from master to disciple.
         Included in these skills were various methods of armed and unarmed combat. Through the study of these skills we are able to maximize mental and physical integration as well as gaining an increased ability to protect our families, loved ones, homes, and property from the negative elements of society.
         At Warrior Wisdom Martial Arts it is our mission to research, cultivate, and disperse this transformational knowledge. We emphasize one on one private instruction so that the specific needs of each student can be met. In each one hour session you will have direct contact with a master instructor,as a result you will excel rapidly and gain practical skill very quickly. 
         Warrior Wisdom is the knowledge gained through the experience of self-mastery, we use martial arts as the method for gaining that experience.
