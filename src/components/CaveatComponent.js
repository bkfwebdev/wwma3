     <p>
     Martial arts training provides a path to self mastery and the opportunity to change your nature, if you are willing to do the work. 
     Our curriculum is taught with the understanding that the student MUST do the work, for each one hour private lesson the student is expected to do a minimum of 5 hours of training and study on his or her own. 
     We are not giving you something that you can put in your pocket and walk away with or something that you can put on like a shirt. 
     We are offering truly transformational knowledge that must be digested and absorbed in order for it to be of any real use. 
     It would be a waste of time to engage in this as casual study, if you are serious then I believe we have what you're looking for. 
     The door is open, the path awaits.
